TOR-SSO Administration Guide

===========================

* Overview

	This document serves as an introduction to administering the TOR-SSO Single Sign On solution for TOR/FREJA. Most of the content is from TOR-SSO's own {{{http://docs.forgerock.org/en/openam/10.0.0/admin-guide/index.html}administration guide}}, which is extensive. The most pertinent items are summarised here

* Maintaining User Information

	Since TOR-SSO communicates directly with a user store (e.g., LDAP) containing all the user information, it is preferable to use the LDAP instance's own user interface for this configuration. However, TOR-SSO offers some rudimentary user administration facilities.

	Once logged into TOR-SSO as the user <<amAdmin>>, navigate (via the web console) to <<Access Control>> -\> <Realm Name> -\> <<Subjects>>. Here you will find basic user administration functions such as create, edit and delete users and groups. Changes made here will be reflected in the underlying LDAP store.

* Logging and Tracing

	There is no capability for viewing log output in the TOR-SSO web console, so the administrator will need shell access to the machine where TOR-SSO is deployed. In the FREJA system, the is RedHat Enterprise Linux.

	By default, TOR-SSO sets its debug and log level to <<<ERROR>>>. Assuming <<<$OPENAM_HOME>>> is the path to where TOR-SSO is deployed, the logs are located at

-------------------------
$OPENAM_HOME/openam/log
$OPENAM_HOME/openam/debug
-------------------------

	Each log entry follows a specific format. The first line after the version number gives a list of headings to show what is being logged. Here's an example of such headings

-------------------------
#Fields: time   Data    LoginID ContextID       IPAddr  LogLevel        Domain  LoggedBy        MessageID       ModuleName      NameID  HostName
-------------------------

	The more important information is under the <<MessageID>> heading. This contains a reference to the {{{http://openam.forgerock.org/openam-documentation/openam-doc-source/doc/reference/index/chap-log-messages.html}TOR-SSO log message reference guide}}

** Log Maintenance

	While no log viewer interface exists in TOR-SSO, there is a useful log maintenance facility. Log in as <<amAdmin>> and navigate to <<Configuration>> -\> <<System>> -\> <<Logging>>. Here the administrator can set such options as overall logging level, maximum log file size, what fields to capture in the log output, and log file location.

	There is also no function for backing up the logs, so this will fall to normal file system backups

* Troubleshooting

	When problems arise with TOR-SSO, a good procedure is to increase the logging level, first to <<DEBUG>>, then if necessary onto the finer levels. Then attempt to recreate the problem and examine the resulting log output. This should give the troubleshooter a log message reference and allow him/her to discover possible actions to correct the problem.
