OpenAM Policy Agent and external Identity Provider 		

========================================================================

* Scope

	This document is not a how-to guide for installing or configuring the technologies listed below. It documents an investigative task as part of the Single Sign On proof of concept (POC).

* Goal

	The investigation task was to find out whether OpenAM Policy Agent is able to communicate through external Identity Provider to LDAP data store.
	
* Requirements

** Summary
	
	Policy Agent(PA) should be verifying user's credentials through the IdP provider and be unaware of where is the data store that is behind the IdP.
	
** Use Case	

	[[1]]	Setup Policy Agent(PA) on Tomcat server which  to protect a sample web application.
 
	[[2]]	The PA must be registered inside a sub-realm using 	OpenAM Configuration Platform. 
	
	[[3]]	In the same sub-realm we have a Circle of Trust(COT) which hots the metadata of an external Identity Provider(IdP). This IdP is connected to 
			communicate to its own LDAP data store to verify the submit credentials by the user.
	
	[[4]]	For the purpose of the test the data store configured for the PA should be empty. The actual registered users are in the data store used by the IdP.
	
	[[5]]	The PA should be configured so that it will forward the AA(Authentication/Authorization) requests towards the IdP. 
	
	[[6]]	The Subject under the Policy can be any name that is to be authenticated.

* Technologies

	* Apache Tomcat v6.0.35

	* OpenAM v10.0.0

	* Policy Agent (Tomcat) v3.0-ER2

* Conclusion

	After setting up the system Wireshark was used to intercept the network packets exchanged among the SSO entities.
	As of today the OpenAM's Policy Agent configuration did not provide a mechanism to setup direct communication with the external IdP.
	PA communicated directly to the external LDAP data store and it only shared the SSO session with the external IdP in the context of the sub-realm.
